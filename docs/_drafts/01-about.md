Bica is intended to be used as a simple starting point when writing CSS. It helps to create and maintain a mindful and scalable CSS structure.

Baselineâ€™s simplicity is a feature. It is planned to be written in vanilla CSS without a build process, some day in the future. For now, PostCSS and its plugins are needed to use future CSS syntax like custom media queries and to compile everything into one file.
