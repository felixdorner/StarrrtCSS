Starrrt leverages tomorrow's CSS syntax and provides styles for most common HTML elements, a grid system (deprecated) and some helpers all interconnected with custom properties to head-start new web projects in a consistent way.

Starrrt arose from the process of duplicating the always same stylesheet setup when I started new projects. This basic setup found a new home here and is going to be improved from time to time. Take it and make it your own.
