1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/felixdorner/baseline/releases/latest)
2. Copy the src folder into your project
3. Setup or integrate files in a build process

<span class="aside-txt">The build process needs to include [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/), [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) and [postcss-easy-import](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-easy-import). View an example of a workflow with simple NPM scripts [here](https://gist.github.com/felixdorner/278fa705aa37cb369a809a4151c7d701).</span>
