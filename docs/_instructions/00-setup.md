1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/felixdorner/cascade/releases/latest)
2. Copy the src folder into your project
3. Integrate files in a build process*

*The build process needs to involve [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/), [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) and [postcss-easy-import](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-easy-import). View an example of a workflow with simple NPM scripts [here](https://gist.github.com/felixdorner/278fa705aa37cb369a809a4151c7d701).
