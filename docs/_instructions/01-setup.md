Download the [latest release](https://github.com/felixdorner/baseline/releases/latest), copy the src folder into your project, and integrate the kit with your build workflow.

Make sure that your task runner processes [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/), [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) and [postcss-easy-import](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-easy-import).
