Download and copy the source files into your new project and integrate them with your workflow. Make sure that your task runner (NPM scripts, Gulp, Grunt, etc.) processes these files with [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/), [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) and [postcss-easy-import](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-easy-import).

*Wait, there is no NPM package?* Nope, you will need to customize Starrrt to make it your own. Starrrt is just a starting point and no "use as is" dev dependency.
